_This is an update to the console.log wrapper; see [this blog post](http://patik.com/blog/complete-cross-browser-console-log/) for background and a more detailed discussion of the problems with console logging._

While logging the console can be useful during development, some browser consoles do not display logged data in a readable, useful format. These primitive consoles do not expand arrays, do not link DOM elements to the source code, print objects as `[object Object]` rather than listing their properties, etc.

<!--more-->

For example, try logging the following in Internet Explorer 8 through 10:

<pre class="brush:js">console.log( "Here's a string",
             3.14,
             {"alpha": 5, "bravo": false},
             document.getElementById('charlie'),
             new Date()
            );
</pre>

It will result in:

On the other hand, [Firebug](http://getfirebug.com/), WebKit&#8217;s [Developer Tools](https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/overview), and Opera&#8217;s [Dragonfly](http://www.opera.com/dragonfly/) print useful, interactive items to the console. Here&#8217;s the same code as above, but this time in Firebug:

## Expanded details

But it is possible to eke a bit more information out of the data in primitive consoles. I&#8217;ve added a [detailed print plugin](https://github.com/patik/console.log-wrapper) to my [console.log](http://patik.com/blog/complete-cross-browser-console-log/) wrapper.

By including the plugin and sending the data to `log()`, the same call as above now looks like this:

<img class="size-full aligncenter" src="http://patik.com/code/console-log-polyfill/ie8-with-detail-print.png" alt="IE8 with detailed print" />

It&#8217;s still not pretty, nor is it linkable like modern consoles. But now instead of `[object Object]` you can see that it was an array (along with its length), or a DOM element (along with its selector), and so on. This can be useful in IE 7/8/9/10, iOS 5 and older, and Opera 11 and older, among others.

## Alternatives

For iOS 5 and older, if you are so inclined you may instead try [installing Firebug](http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/installing-firebug-browsers-ios/) or using a remote debugging tool like [Adobe Edge Inspect](http://html.adobe.com/edge/inspect/) or [Weinre](http://people.apache.org/~pmuellr/weinre/docs/latest/).

If you&#8217;re sticking to modern browsers, you can simply ignore the new `consolelog.detailprint.js` plugin and continue to use `log()` as usual.

Thanks to [JÃ¶rn Berkefeld](http://www.bittubes.com/) for pointing out that this was [needed on iOS 5](https://github.com/patik/console.log-wrapper/issues/7) and for testing.
