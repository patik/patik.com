[Google Voice](https://www.google.com/voice), the service that gives you a universal phone number, free SMS, and text transcripts of your voicemail, is now letting new users [keep their current phone number](http://googlevoiceblog.blogspot.com/2009/10/google-voice-with-your-existing-number.html) when signing up. On the surface this sounds like a great new addition that will entice users who were scared off by the idea of giving up their current number. But in reality, this is actually a stripped down version of the service that not only removes functionality but actually restricts how users can use their phones. (This new option is **not** the same as [porting your number](http://www.fcc.gov/cib/consumerfacts/numbport.html), something Google expects to roll out in the future.) <img class="alignright size-full wp-image-106" title="Google Voice" src="http://patik.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Google-Voice-2561.png" alt="Google Voice" width="176" height="176" srcset="http://patik.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Google-Voice-2561.png 256w, http://patik.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Google-Voice-2561-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 176px) 100vw, 176px" />

When a new user receives and accepts their Google Voice (GV) invite, they&#8217;re presented with two options:

1. to keep their current number, or
2. the &#8216;classic&#8217; option of getting a new GV number, then associating their phones with that

Choose wisely, because if you pick Option #1, [there&#8217;s no going back](http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/voice/thread?fid=02b0c1e599ff0a17000476ea06818daa&hl=en 'See the first reply'). In other words, you can&#8217;t get a new GV number and all the features and options that go with it. Even worse, you&#8217;ll be stuck using Google&#8217;s voicemail system (and not your carrier&#8217;s) whether you like it or not.

That sounds harsh, but fortunately you can get all the features _and_ keep your current number by choosing Option #2.

If you choose Option #2, you simply select a new GV number,Â  then add your cell phone to your account. You can then optionally activate the voicemail features on your cell phone &#8212; the same ones trumpeted under the banner of Option #1 on GV&#8217;s sign up page.

Basically, &#8220;keep my number&#8221; is a lite version of the service with fewer features. There is no good reason to choose it &#8212; if you think it&#8217;s a hassle to get a new phone number &#8212; and [it&#8217;s really not](http://lifehacker.com/5311254/how-to-ease-your-transition-to-google-voice 'Lifehacker: How to Ease Your Transition to Google Voice') &#8212; just don&#8217;t give it out to anyone. No one you call or text will know the difference.

**_Update_**_: Nearly two months later, Google finally added the option to_ [_get your own Google Voice number_](<http://googlevoiceblog.blogspot.com/2009/12/few-weeks-ago-we-launched-ability-to.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+GoogleVoiceBlog+(Google+Voice+Blog)&utm_content=Google+Reader>) _even if you didn&#8217;t choose one initially._
