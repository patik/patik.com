# A statically generated blog using Next.js, Markdown, and TypeScript

<http://patik.com/blog/>

Forked from Vercel's [blog-starter](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/blog-starter). Uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) [(v3.0)](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v3).

The blog posts are stored in `/_posts` as Markdown files with front matter support. Adding a new Markdown file in there will create a new blog post.
