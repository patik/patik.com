This is my personal web site's files. There isn't much useful here to anyone else except maybe in the `/code/` directory. I'm mostly using it for version control (I like to revamp the site every so often) and for keeping my git chops nimble.

Some of the directories contain files from many years ago, when I didn't even know why inline styles or standards-compliant JavaScript was important. Please don't laugh :)
