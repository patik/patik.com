It has always been inevitable that Twitter would be used for spam, and perhaps what’s most discouraging is that it’s the useful sites like [Tweetgrid](http://www.tweetgrid.com/) that make gathering usernames so easy. All a spammer needs to do is search for a couple key words related to their product, and then send links to those users. Such a process can be, and already is, easily automated in real time.

An example struck me today. While the Premier League [can’t seem to grasp](http://blog.footytweets.com/2009/04/the-footytweets-cease-and-desist-story/) the marketing potential of Twitter and the web in general, the nefarious UK betting sites are all over it. One cannot mention the name of a club without finding a couple “so-and-so is now following you on Twitter” emails in the inbox shortly thereafter. Today I tried [tweeting about a match](http://twitter.com/Ellsass/status/1587237261) using alternative names, referring to [Chelsea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.) as Chelski (quite original, I know), but even so I was immediately [pounced upon](http://twitter.com/ChelskiBet/status/1587239870) by a site called ChelskiBet. Sure enough, the account had a low followers/following ratio and all of its messages were links to a betting site.

How useful can Twitter be if people have to resort to alternative wording to avoid spam? Tweeting “just got tickets for the Y@nkeez game” is not only quite annoying, but it also makes search and discovery difficult for legitimate users. It is also, as I found out, an uphill battle as spammers simply catch on and adapt.

Should Twitter start using Gmail-like filtering for spam?
